Quotes:
- We went on; without thought, without care, with nothing to feel save the song of
  our body.
- 'I am. I think. I will. '
- My hands...My spirit...My sky...My Forest...This earth of mine...
- I stand here on the summit of the mountains. I lift my head and I spread my arms.
  This, my body and spirit, this is the end of the quest. I wished to know the meaning
  of things. I am the meaning. I wished to find a warrant for being. I need no warrant
  for being, and no word of sanction upon my being. I am the warrant and the sanction.
- It is my eyes which see, and the sight of my eyes grants beauty to the earth. It
  is my ears which hear, and the hearing of my ears gives its song to the world. It
  is my mind which thinks, and the judgement of my mind is the only searchlight that
  can find the truth. It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the
  only edict I must respect.
- Whatever road I take, the guiding star is within me; the guiding star and the lodestone
  which point the way. They point in but one direction. They point to me.
- I know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the universe or if it is
  but a speck of dust lost in eternity. I know not and I care not. For I know what
  happiness is possible to me on earth. And my happiness needs no higher aim to vindicate
  it. My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own goal.
  It is its own purpose.
